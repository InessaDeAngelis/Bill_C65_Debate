2018-02-07,"Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear on this matter. Inappropriate sexual behaviour of any kind is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Our government has been very clear that we are committed to a harassment-free workplace for all Canadians. We have recently tabled Bill C-65, and we have a proven track record on this matter. 
Though I cannot speak to the specifics of this case, as a government we have made our approach clear on issues like these, and we will continue along this path. ",Liberal,Vancouver South,Harjit S. Sajjan
