2018-02-07,"Hon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition, CPC)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, the Liberals have shamefully opened a new front in their legal battle with our veterans. This time, the Prime Minister claims that it is not up to him to provide a safe, harassment-free workplace in the Canadian Armed Forces or to develop polices to prevent sexual harassment or sexual assault.
Will the Prime Minister explain why he is so determined to keep attacking our veterans, but lets known terrorists off the hook with a $10-million cheque? ",Conservative,Regina—Qu'Appelle,Andrew Scheer
2018-02-07,"Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear on this matter. Inappropriate sexual behaviour of any kind is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Our government has been very clear that we are committed to a harassment-free workplace for all Canadians. We have recently tabled Bill C-65, and we have a proven track record on this matter. 
Though I cannot speak to the specifics of this case, as a government we have made our approach clear on issues like these, and we will continue along this path. ",Liberal,Vancouver South,Harjit S. Sajjan
2018-02-07,"Hon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition, CPC)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, I can speak to the specifics of this case. The minister specifically instructed his lawyers to argue that the armed forces do not have a duty to provide women a safe place to work. That is shameful, and they have also specifically excluded the armed forces from their legislation. 
Why does the Prime Minister say one thing when it is all about symbolism, but when it is about the hard work of actually implementing these things, he is missing in action?",Conservative,Regina—Qu'Appelle,Andrew Scheer
2018-02-07,"Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, as I stated, I cannot speak to the specifics of this case, but we are committed to making sure that we have a harassment-free workplace in the Canadian Armed Forces. We encourage all members to come forward. With our new defence policy, we are investing in our people to make sure we get this job done. ",Liberal,Vancouver South,Harjit S. Sajjan
2018-02-07,"Hon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition, CPC)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government is arguing in court that it has no duty to provide a safe place for women to work in the armed forces. That is shameful, and it flies in the face of every phony statement the Prime Minister has ever said on this issue.
The Prime Minister cannot blame a government lawyer. The Prime Minister actually instituted a cabinet committee to oversee litigation, to put a political screen on all these types of arguments. Who sits on that committee? It is the Minister of Justice. What does the Minister of Justice think about her government's lawyers arguing this in court?",Conservative,Regina—Qu'Appelle,Andrew Scheer
2018-02-07,"Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, our track record on this matter has been very clear since the time we formed government. Since September 2015, 55 members have been released due to inappropriate sexual behaviour. We are committed to making sure that we have a harassment-free workplace within the Canadian Armed Forces, and Operation Honour is going to get that job done. ",Liberal,Vancouver South,Harjit S. Sajjan
2018-02-07,"Hon. Lisa Raitt (Milton, CPC)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, words do not lie, and doublespeak is very clear in the following case. The Minister of Defence, on his own website, pledges that the “Canadian Armed Forces is fully committed to providing a workplace free from harassment and discrimination”, yet the lawyers for the government said that it is not their job to “care to individual members within the CAF to provide a safe and harassment-free work environment”. Which is it? Do they stand with women in the forces, or do they not?",Conservative,Milton,Lisa Raitt
2018-02-07,"Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, I could not be clearer on this matter. We are going to stomp this problem out. Operation Honour was created on this matter, and our defence policy is going to make sure that we create the proper environment to allow any Canadian who wants to join the Canadian Armed Forces to be able to pursue a career and develop to his or her full potential. ",Liberal,Vancouver South,Harjit S. Sajjan
2018-02-07,"Hon. Lisa Raitt (Milton, CPC)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, the most tawdry part of all this is that the litigation committee of cabinet, which is charged with overseeing how lawyers are instructed, has five women sitting on it. Do any of those five female Liberal ministers want to stand up and let us know exactly why they think it is okay that they have protection in the workplace and yet women in the forces do not? Will they pull this brief?",Conservative,Milton,Lisa Raitt
2018-02-07,"Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, we have zero tolerance for any type of sexual misbehaviour—",Liberal,Vancouver South,Harjit S. Sajjan
2018-02-07,NA,Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces," Oh, oh!",NA,NA,Some hon. members
2018-02-07,The Speaker,Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Order. Yes, it is Wednesday, but the rules still apply. Members are familiar with the Standing Orders and the rule against interrupting. 
The hon. Minister of National Defence has the floor. ",Liberal,Halifax West,Geoff Regan
2018-02-07,"Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, let me be extremely clear. We have absolute zero tolerance for any type of behaviour like this, and that is exactly what we are going to do. We have committed to this in our defence policy, and we are going to get the job done. ",Liberal,Vancouver South,Harjit S. Sajjan
2018-02-07,"Ms. Ruth Ellen Brosseau (Berthier—Maskinongé, NDP)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, victims of sexual assault and harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces launched a class action lawsuit in May.
On January 29, in response to my question on sexual violence and harassment, the Prime Minister said, “This is a problem that has gone on for far too long, and it is time we dealt with it, particularly here in Parliament, where we set an example for the rest of the country.”
However, by attempting to quash the lawsuit, the example the Prime Minister is setting is completely irresponsible and reprehensible.
Will the Prime Minister withdraw the government's attempts to discredit these victims?",New Democratic Party,Berthier—Maskinongé,Ruth Ellen Brosseau
2018-02-07,"Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for her passion on this issue.
As I stated, we want to be able to work with the opposition on this issue, because this is an important issue that impacts all of us. We need to make sure that we have a harassment-free workplace, especially in the Canadian Armed Forces, and with our new defence policy and with Operation Honour we are going to get the job done.",Liberal,Vancouver South,Harjit S. Sajjan
2018-02-07,"Ms. Ruth Ellen Brosseau (Berthier—Maskinongé, NDP)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, whether here on Parliament Hill or in the forces, the days of sexual harassment, bullying, and inappropriate behaviour are done. The women and men who have served our country want to know what their government plans to do to change the culture within the Canadian military. These women and men expect more than just a discussion with the minister. They want meaningful action today.
What is the government's plan?",New Democratic Party,Berthier—Maskinongé,Ruth Ellen Brosseau
2018-02-07,"Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Canadian Armed Forces,"Mr. Speaker, as part of Operation Honour we are going to get the job done. Every person who willingly serves our country despite the many dangers and sacrifices of military service deserves a professional environment in which he or she is treated with respect and dignity. That is the type of path that we are going to go on and we are going to get the job done.",Liberal,Vancouver South,Harjit S. Sajjan
