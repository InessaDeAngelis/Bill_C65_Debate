2018-05-09,"Ms. Pam Damoff (Oakville North—Burlington, Lib.)",Statements By Members,Status of Women,"Mr. Speaker, last week we heard over and over again disconcerting things from Conservative political leaders across the country denying the facts and ignoring the real barriers faced by women in politics. Our government understands that women in politics face sexism, harassment, and other systemic barriers, and we are working to eliminate these factors.
That is why we are working with organizations like Equal Voice and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to find out why there are fewer female elected representatives than male. 
We also announced $18 million in funding to enhance the participation of women, including indigenous women, as leaders in their communities.
We have introduced Bill C-65 to address harassment and sexual violence. Our government knows that we simply cannot move forward when half of us are held back.",Liberal,Oakville North—Burlington,Pam Damoff
