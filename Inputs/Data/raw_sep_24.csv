2018-09-24,Ms. Pam Damoff,Government Orders,Accessible Canada Act,"Madam Speaker, at this point I am not on the committee, although I did sit on the committee when it reviewed Bill C-65.
My experience on committee has been that there is really good work that happens there. Bill C-65 would be a prime example, where really important amendments were brought forward.
In my opinion, it is critical that this bill be implemented. I know the minister has made a commitment to see that this is legislation that will impact people's lives and not years from now, but in the near term.
I look forward to the deliberations that happen at committee and to hearing from witnesses. If there are improvements to be made, the committee will benefit from the expertise that will be provided at the committee meetings.",Liberal,Oakville Northâ€”Burlington,Pam Damoff
