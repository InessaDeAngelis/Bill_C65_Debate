2018-04-30,"Hon. Mark Eyking (Sydney—Victoria, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Workplace Safety,"Mr. Speaker, this past Saturday on our national day of mourning for injured workers, I had the honour of representing our government at a ceremony in Whitney Pier hosted by our local unions. I got to meet not only injured workers, but also families that lost their loved ones at the work site. Over the past two years, our government has brought in new measures to modernize the Canada Labour Code to better support Canadian workers and the businesses that employ them.
Could the minister tell the House what other steps our government is taking to protect Canadians in the workplace?",Liberal,Sydney—Victoria,Mark Eyking
2018-04-30,"Hon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Workplace Safety,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Sydney—Victoria for his tireless work on behalf of injured workers.
My sincerest condolences go out to the families, friends, and colleagues of the victims so deeply affected by these tragedies.
Not all workplace injuries are physical. To help put an end to harassment and sexual violence, our government has introduced the historic Bill C-65.
We are going to continue to work with the labour movement, with employers, and provincial and territorial partners to improve work environments, to better protect the safety of Canadian workers.",Liberal,Thunder Bay—Superior North,Patty Hajdu
