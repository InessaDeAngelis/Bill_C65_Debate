2018-04-30,"Hon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Workplace Safety,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Sydney—Victoria for his tireless work on behalf of injured workers.
My sincerest condolences go out to the families, friends, and colleagues of the victims so deeply affected by these tragedies.
Not all workplace injuries are physical. To help put an end to harassment and sexual violence, our government has introduced the historic Bill C-65.
We are going to continue to work with the labour movement, with employers, and provincial and territorial partners to improve work environments, to better protect the safety of Canadian workers.",Liberal,Thunder Bay—Superior North,Patty Hajdu
