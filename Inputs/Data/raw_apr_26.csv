2018-04-26,"Ms. Anne Minh-Thu Quach (Salaberry—Suroît, NDP)",Oral Questions,Status of Women,"Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's symbolic gestures and words are wonderful, but they are not enough.
We are still waiting for pay equity legislation and it is now 2018. Several women's groups that came here for the G7 summit took the opportunity to remind the government that it is not doing nearly enough to achieve equality and to protect the most vulnerable women.
The Prime Minister stated that he wanted to lead by example at the summit, but what is his plan? How will he convince his G7 counterparts to adopt feminist measures when his own credibility is being called into question?",New Democratic Party,Salaberry—Suroît,Anne Minh-Thu Quach
2018-04-26,"Hon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Status of Women,"Mr. Speaker, our government understands that we cannot move forward when half of us are being held back, and that is why we have made gender equality a priority.
With budget 2018, we are taking leadership to address the gender wage gap, to institute proactive pay equity legislation, to enhance parental leave options, to tackle gender-based violence and harassment, to introduce a new entrepreneurship strategy for women, to invest in the sustainability of grassroots organizations that advocate on behalf of women, and so much more.
This is a government that takes gender equality extremely seriously and puts its money where its mouth is.",Liberal,Thunder Bay—Superior North,Patty Hajdu
2018-04-26,"Ms. Niki Ashton (Churchill—Keewatinook Aski, NDP)",Oral Questions,Status of Women,"Mr. Speaker, we have heard that the attack in Toronto may have been inspired by the misogynistic and hateful movement “incels”.
We must acknowledge that attacks from these groups are a form of violence rooted in misogyny. We must believe women and end the hate that they face online and off-line. Saying one is a feminist is simply not enough. We must take action. The special rapporteur for the UN said that the government's fragmented approach to gender-based violence is not working.
The Prime Minister is all words. Where is the concrete plan, with resources, to end gender-based violence in Canada?",New Democratic Party,Churchill—Keewatinook Aski,Niki Ashton
2018-04-26,"Hon. Ralph Goodale (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Status of Women,"Mr. Speaker, this is a profoundly serious issue.
I would note that in the last two budgets, there have been specific increases in resources from the Government of Canada to tackle problems of exactly this kind. I also had the opportunity at the beginning of this week to discuss this issue with G7 security ministers, with a view to making sure that those who provide communication services are aware of their responsibilities to work with government and to work with civil society to bring that foul and vile material off the Internet.",Liberal,Regina—Wascana,Ralph Goodale
2018-04-26,"Ms. Cheryl Hardcastle (Windsor—Tecumseh, NDP)",Oral Questions,Status of Women,"Mr. Speaker, women with mental health or cognitive-related issues are four times more likely to report experiencing sexual violence. The government's response to this shocking reality has been with Bill C-65 and social development programs. This is woefully inadequate, due to the harsh reality.
I would like to hear the government explain to us today why it is not taking this issue seriously and what it is actually going to do now.",New Democratic Party,Windsor—Tecumseh,Cheryl Hardcastle
2018-04-26,"Hon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Status of Women,"Mr. Speaker, we share the member's horror at the experience women have every single day in this country with gender-based violence. That is why, as a former minister of status of women, I was so honoured to be part of creating the very first federal gender-based violence strategy, which we have funded to the tune of at least $100 million, with more in budget 2018.
My colleague, the Minister of Status of Women, is currently working with grassroots organizations to ensure the full implementation of the gender-based violence strategy.
Bill C-65 is historic legislation in that it will provide protection for federally regulated workers and—",Liberal,Thunder Bay—Superior North,Patty Hajdu
2018-04-26,"Hon. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Status of Women,"Mr. Speaker, Canada is hosting G7 countries throughout 2018 and at the leaders' summit discussions in June in Charlevoix, Quebec. The empowerment of women is at the head of this agenda, and it is critical in these talks, since the empowerment of women can achieve global peace, can achieve economic empowerment, and can assist economies in becoming more inclusive and more generous.
Now, can the Minister of Status of Women tell us what she is doing at these talks to bring about gender-based analysis and gender-based analysis plus?",Liberal,Vancouver Centre,Hedy Fry
2018-04-26,"Mr. Terry Duguid (Parliamentary Secretary for Status of Women, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Status of Women,"Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Vancouver Centre for her question and for her tireless advocacy. Advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls is a top priority for Canada's 2018 G7 presidency. This week, two key meetings of feminist leaders, the Gender Equality Advisory Council and the Women 7 (W7), were convened in Ottawa. Through their work, grassroots and feminist voices from various backgrounds will help G7 leaders identify the most pressing issues facing the world's women and girls.",Liberal,Winnipeg South,Terry Duguid
