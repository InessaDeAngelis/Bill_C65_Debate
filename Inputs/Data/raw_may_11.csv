2018-05-11,"Mr. Rodger Cuzner (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Health,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Nepean for reminding us that this week is Mental Health Week. 
Our government is focused on ensuring federally regulated workers have healthy and safe workplaces. We introduced Bill C-65, a historic piece of legislation, to put an end to harassment and sexual violence in the federal sector and here on Parliament Hill. We have also introduced the right to request flexible work arrangements and new leave provisions for workers so they can better balance work with family responsibilities. 
This week and every day, we will support those struggling with mental health issues.",Liberal,Cape Bretonâ€”Canso,Rodger Cuzner
