2018-02-05,"Hon. Carla Qualtrough (Minister of Public Services and Procurement, Lib.)",Oral Questions,Canada Post,"Mr. Speaker, harassment and bullying of any kind are unacceptable, period. My office has reached out to the individual from Winnipeg who raised these concerns. Canada Post has policies in place to address issues of harassment, and we will make sure that this policy is being followed.
Our government ran on a commitment to take action on workplace harassment in federally regulated workplaces. That is why all parties worked to get Bill C-65 to committee, which would create a more robust regime that would better address harassment and violence in the workplace, including at Canada Post.",Liberal,Delta,Carla Qualtrough
